# PiNetworkMonitor
Python script to power a Raspberry Pi (from 2012!) which monitors internet connectivity, logs ping speed, and emails you daily results.

Code written for use in Raspberry Pi, running Raspian. However, tested and functional on OSX (as long as you disable GPIO).
Note - May 2024 : I was very much a rookie programmer when I made this. Please note that using this code means you will likely have to debug code I made before I went to school for my CS degree. Thanks!
